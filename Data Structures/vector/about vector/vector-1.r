#A vector is a basic data structure in R. It is a sequence of elements of the same type.

#To create a vector, we need to use the c() function and separate the elements by commas.


res <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, "reza")

print(res)

#To access an element of the vector, we need to refer to it using its index in square brackets.
#For example, let's output the 2nd element

res <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

print(res[2])
