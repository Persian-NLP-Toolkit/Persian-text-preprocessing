#As we have seen in the previous lessons, we can output values using the print and the cat functions.


x <- 'Alireza'

cat(x)

#You can use the \n special symbol to add new lines to text.

y <- 'hello\nhow are you'

print(y)

cat(y)

#Note that the cat function shows the line break in the output, while the print function shows the \n character without the line break.
